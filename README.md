# Scrabble Bruteforce
I suck at scrabble, what else can I say.

Imagine this, it's 3am and you're playing scrabble with a friend through an app you just downloaded from your app store, you lose real bad, but then you realise that you're a software developer. 

What do you do?

That's right, here's a project that allows you to cycle through the official Scrabble dictionary with hopes of saving your game!
Once it does find any possible combos from the terrible letters you have, it will print them out in the console!

> Do note that you may need to set a Java version in your project settings as it was built with an older version of java.
